I've drawn the idea out on microsoft paint in the attachment

I'm looking for a python script that can read a JSON file and extract 5 key pieces of information,
validate the information, and clean the extraction if needed, which is then used to update a spreadsheet if the
value in the spreadsheet is different.

* I mean for all cells, if there is no new data, then the old one remains as it was previously

# todo: 5 key pieces of information:
1. Doc Ref (document_id)
2. Doc Title (title)
3. Rev (Revision)
4. Purpose of issue (PurposeOfIssue)
5. Status (Status)
